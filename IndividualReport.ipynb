User-inputted information is not always 100% accurate, as some users may falsify their Age, gender, or name.\n",

    "\n",
    "The broad question this project will address is \"What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?\"The `players.csv` dataset is ideal, as it contains variables such as `Age`, `gender`, and `experience`, along with the logical variable `subscribe` (TRUE if subscribed, FALSE if not). This allows for specific analysis of if experience level and hours played can predict players are subscribed to the game-related newsletter."
